# Acceptance Testing

Automating UI tests helps minimize the time and human effort required to test an applicationâ€™s UI for regression. Instead of having a tester validate every single aspect of the UI, test scripts are created for corresponding user scenarios. These test scripts can verify the integrity of the project before deployment.
